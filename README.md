This is a sandbox project to get familiar with the format of the Reaction Commerce platform.

To run the application, use $ reaction

*note  Schemas are located in lib/collections/schemas

*look in server/startup/load-data.js for importing data.

*images are located in public/resources


This doesn't seem like it can be done AFTER the project has been started...  But for next time (meteor settings):
to configure the initial Reaction Administrator, created a settings/settings.json file (which prevents the default of dev.settings.json)


To work with the mongoDB shell, open a new terminal window, make sure you are in the reaction folder, and enter   
$meteor mongo
view the mongoDB at localhost 3001
